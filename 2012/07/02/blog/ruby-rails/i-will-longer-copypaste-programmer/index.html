          <h1>I will no longer be a Copy/Paste Programmer</h1>
          <p>You heard me right. And I expect you to hold me to it. The last two years of my professional career as a front-end developer and occasional backend coder, taught me how to search first on Google, Stack Overflow or my favorite design blog whenever I was trying to figure out how to solve a problem. Most of the time this worked pretty well for me. I found someone's generous blog post, copied the code, made some adjustments to the functions or variable to make them work with my particular situation and moved on. Things got done, but I've come to realize over the past month of Dev Bootcamp that there is a serious problem with making this your primary source of research and learning. I've made the commitment to no longer be a copy/paste programmer and instead truly understand the principles and problems that I am trying to solve when I am researching an answer.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-hit-a-problem-or-question-in-your-coding-dont-immediately-google-the-relevant-keywords">When you hit a problem or question in your coding, don't immediately google the relevant keywords.</h3>
<p>Take a few minutes and think about what problem you are trying to solve and what you are truly having trouble with. Often times, I have found that I don't even really fully understand the problem that I'm trying to solve yet and taking a step back, drawing out the flow on paper goes a long way towards finding a solution.</p>

<h3 id="try-through-the-documentation-that-applies-to-the-problem-that-you-are-trying-to-solve">Try through the documentation that applies to the problem that you are trying to solve.**</h3>
<p>Looking through relevant and accurate documentation such as
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/">Ruby-Docs</a> or
<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">JQuery</a> JS library, is ultimately going to help you learn a lot more than immediately jumping on Google. Good documentation is a treasure-trove of information and I'm coming to love learning about the crazy useful methods that these libraries provide for me to use! The examples are normally clear and accurate, but are general enough that they will force you to adapt them to your own particular needs. I find this really helps me learn conceptually what I'm doing.</p>

<h3 id="savor-the-satisfaction-of-solving-the-problem">Savor the satisfaction of solving the problem.</h3>
<p>Sure you want to get faster at development, but if you can learn something the first time and don't have to google it again, and again, it's probably going to save you time in the long run. Try searching for methods or functions that can help you solve your particular problem rather than the solution itself. It's tempting to cut corners and save time, but remember this is
yourcode. Take pride in tackling your engineering challenge!</p>

<p>I'm not saying not to use the wonderful resources out there. I'm saying that I will no longer be a copy/paste programmer that mindlessly searches, finds the correct code and drops into my own work. I want to do better for myself and for my future in programming.</p>
